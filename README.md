# Just an Angular practice

Nothing special :)

## Now there are two components.

### 1) Component app/practices/http/http-api.component

This component is a practice for http request with promises and obsevables. It's very simple: there are 8 buttons, each button makes a request to an endpoint than returns the request info sent to this endpont. The firsts buttons makes simples requesto with its common verbs (GET, POST, PUT and PATCH). The seconds buttons make a successful promise, error promise and error observable request. And the last button makes a request with header. That's it :) Very simple, isn't it? 

### 2) Component app/practices/http/http-promise-api.component

This component is not finished yet... But it consist in a field witch makes a request to the itunes api when you write on it. I'll finish it soon :)
